# Overview
The ECG Analyzer is a web application that predicts heart diseases from uploaded electrocardiogram images using ResNet50, a deep learning model with **94.84%** accuracy and **24.55%** loss. It enhances cardiac diagnostics for healthcare professionals and offers a reliable tool for medical students to analyze ECG data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Ch. Pervaiz Elahi Institute of Cardiology Multan Dataset** (Khan & Hussain, 2021). 
It contains a total of 928 images categorized into four classes:
- **ECG Images of Myocardial Infarction Patients**
- **ECG Images of Patients with Abnormal Heartbeat**
- **ECG Images of Patients with a History of MI (Myocardial Infarction)**
- **Normal Person ECG Images**

This diverse dataset ensures that the model can effectively distinguish between different types of heart conditions.
